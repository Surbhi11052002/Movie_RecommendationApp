 REACT DOM
- we only call it once in our entire application
- it is used to render our components and our entire 
  application into the real dom(into div with an id of root)
-this is how we   are accessing the basic dom .

-there is a rule that react has if you want to render two differwnt elements,one next to another 
   you need to wrap them in a so called react fragment.


COMPONENTS
Components in React basically return a piece of JSX code that tells what
 should be rendered on the screen.

PROPS
-Props is short for properties and they are used to pass data between React components. Reactâ€™s data
   flow between components is uni-directional (from parent to child only).


REACT STATE
-The state is an updatable structure that is used to contain data or information about the component. The state in a component can change over time. The change in state over time can
   happen as a response to user action or system event.
   A component with the state is known as stateful components.

HOOK
-whenever you call something as a function and it starts with use 
  it is a hook.
-



PROJECT 
we have to export every single component so that we can use it somewhere else.
